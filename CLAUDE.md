# Polyglot Slides — working notes

## Where things live

- `src/` — the add-on itself. `Code.js` (modes, selection, translation),
  `Sidebar.html` (the sidebar UI), `appsscript.json` (manifest + OAuth scopes).
- `README.md` — what it does, the modes, known limitations, and the developer
  loop (`clasp push`, test deployments).
- `INSTALL.md` — how a non-developer installs it today, the owner-side sharing
  setup, the staged template deck's IDs, and the second-account verification
  checklist. **Interim by design** — see its shelf-life note; most of it is
  superseded when #4 lands.
- `tools/sync-template.sh` — pushes `src/` into the template deck's bound script.
- `tools/release.sh` + `deployment.json` — tagged-release pipeline (version +
  deploy); `.github/workflows/` runs it. README "Release pipeline" is the
  human-facing doc, including the secret setup and the manual remainder.
- `marketplace/` — the Workspace Marketplace listing as data: `listing.json`
  (what a human pastes into the Marketplace SDK / consent screen), the icon
  and screenshots, and `RUNBOOK.md` (the click-through). `docs/` is the
  GitHub Pages site (homepage + privacy + terms) brand verification needs.
  `tools/check-listing.sh` is the contract: listing scopes == manifest scopes,
  deployment pointer == `deployment.json` (a check aimed at a field the
  Editor-add-on console form doesn't consume — see #29), assets exist at the right sizes,
  publisher is `sprue.works` with an `@sprue.works` support address (brand
  verification checks name, support email, and homepage domain agree).
- This file — gotchas that aren't visible from the code.

Two user-facing surfaces deliver messages differently and always have: sidebar
runs write to `#status` in `Sidebar.html`, menu runs call `SlidesApp.getUi()
.alert()` in `menuRun_`. That asymmetry is tracked in #6, not a bug to fix
in passing.

## The script project's *name* is user-visible

`onOpen` uses `Ui.createAddonMenu()`. For a **container-bound** script (which is
how the template deck in [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) ships), the Extensions submenu
takes **the script project's name**, not the deck's name and not anything in the
code. Google's reference is explicit: "if the script is bound to the document
directly, the sub-menu name matches the script's name."

So `clasp create --type slides --title "X"` names *both* the new deck and its
bound script `X`, and `X` is then what every recipient is told to click. Create
the bound script with the title **`Polyglot Slides`** and rename the *deck*
afterwards (Drive rename; it does not touch the script project). Getting this
backwards produces an `Extensions → Polyglot Slides — Template` menu that no
documentation matches.

## The template deck holds a second copy of the source

`src/` is pushed to two different script projects:

- the dev project in `.clasp.json` (`clasp push`), used for Path B and for
  day-to-day iteration;
- the template deck's **bound** script (`tools/sync-template.sh`), which is what
  recipients actually copy.

They drift silently — nothing fails, new recipients just get old code. Run
`tools/sync-template.sh` after any `src/` change that should reach new users.
`sync-template.sh` pushes from a scratch directory precisely so it can never
shadow or rewrite the repo's own `.clasp.json`.

Copies already made never update. That is inherent to bound scripts, not a bug
to fix — automatic updates need the Marketplace path (#4).

## Testing the install path needs a second Google account

The owner's account cannot exercise the flow that matters (a non-owner copying
a view-only deck and hitting the unverified-app consent screen). Don't claim the
install path is verified off owner-side testing; INSTALL.md carries the
second-account checklist.

## CI deploys authenticate as a user, and the deployment ID is *not* what the Marketplace pins

- Apps Script's API rejects service accounts for script projects, so
  `deploy.yml` uses a copied `~/.clasprc.json` (secret `CLASPRC_JSON`) handed to
  clasp 3 via the `clasp_config_auth` env var. The secret is the **whole** file
  (`{"tokens":{"default":{...}}}`), not a token; clasp 3 also reads the legacy
  `{token, oauth2ClientSettings}` shape, so a clasp 2 file works too. Don't
  read the local `~/.clasprc.json` — it's a credential file.
- GitHub Actions expression contexts are placement-sensitive: `runner.*` is
  unavailable in job-level `env`, even though the file is valid YAML. Run
  `tools/lint-workflows.sh` after workflow edits; it uses actionlint to catch
  expression-context failures before GitHub rejects the workflow definition.
- **Corrected 2026-09-02 (#19):** the Marketplace SDK App Configuration for an
  *Editor add-on* pins **Project Script ID + script version number**, and has
  no deployment-ID field at all — that field exists only for the *Google
  Workspace add-on* integration type, a different architecture (`addOns`
  manifest block, card UI) this add-on does not use. Google's docs: "to
  publish an Editor add-on, you must provide the project script ID and
  version", and to ship an update, "update the version number on the App
  Configuration page". Earlier notes here claimed the listing points at a
  deployment ID and that releases reach installed users automatically; both
  were wrong. The real path is: tag → `tools/release.sh` creates version *n*
  → **a human bumps *Slides add-on script version* to *n*** in App
  Configuration (RUNBOOK §4). A version bump alone does not trigger
  Marketplace re-review; users don't reinstall. Reworking `release.sh`,
  `deployment.json`, and `check-listing.sh` around the version number is #29.
- Until #29 lands, `tools/release.sh` still *updates* the deployment in
  `deployment.json` (`clasp redeploy <id> -V <n>`) rather than `clasp
  deploy`-ing a new one each tag, and `check-listing.sh` still asserts the
  listing's pointer at it. Harmless (the Marketplace ignores that deployment),
  but don't read it as the thing that ships code to users — the version
  number is. The number a release prints is the one to paste.
- `tools/test-release.sh` pins the exact clasp call sequence with a stub. Change
  the sequence deliberately and update the expectations together.

## The listing is data the human pastes, and CI guards the paste

Google has no write API for the Marketplace SDK listing or the OAuth consent
screen, so `marketplace/listing.json` can't be *applied* — it's the paste
source, and `tools/check-listing.sh` is what keeps the paste honest. Two
consequences:

- Changing `oauthScopes` in `appsscript.json` fails CI until `listing.json`
  matches — on purpose. A scope change also needs the consent screen and the
  Marketplace SDK updated by hand and triggers re-verification; the CI failure
  is the reminder.
- The Editor-add-on listing is pinned to the **script ID plus a version
  number** (RUNBOOK §4), not to `deployment.json#deploymentId` and not to
  HEAD. A tagged release does nothing for installed users until that version
  field is bumped by hand; `listing.json`'s `extension.deployment` pointer is
  legacy until #29 replaces it with the script ID + published version.
- Console facts the runbook now carries because they aren't in Google's docs:
  Apps Script refuses *Change GCP project* until the target project has a
  saved OAuth consent screen (so consent screen before attach);
  `script.container.ui` is absent from the *Add or remove scopes* table and
  must be pasted into *Manually add scopes*; it is classified **sensitive**
  (sensitive-scope verification — justification + demo video — not brand
  verification alone; CASA is for *restricted* scopes only); the Marketplace
  SDK has no left-nav entry (its API Library page → *Manage*); App visibility
  Private/Public is irreversible once saved. GCP project number: 556097262294.

## QuickLook thumbnails don't scale SVGs with an intrinsic size

`tools/render-icons.sh` falls back to macOS `qlmanage -t -s 512` when
`rsvg-convert` is missing. QuickLook draws the SVG at its **intrinsic**
`width`/`height` (128×128 on `icon.svg`) onto the requested canvas without
scaling, so the mark lands in the top-left quarter of a 512×512 white square
and `sips -z` then shrinks that whole padded canvas. Every icon PNG passed the
dimensions-only check that way (#27). The script now rewrites the root
`width`/`height` to the render size in a scratch copy before thumbnailing, and
`tools/png-check.js` (shared with `tools/check-listing.sh`) fails any icon
whose artwork doesn't reach all four quadrants. Don't infer a render is right
from its pixel size — open the PNG.

## The Pages hostname is one DNS-only CNAME

`polyglot.sprue.works` must be exactly one Cloudflare CNAME to
`sprue-works.github.io` with `proxied=false`. Cloudflare proxying hides the
Pages target and can block GitHub's domain verification and managed-certificate
provisioning. `tools/reconcile-pages-dns.sh` is intentionally conservative:
it creates a missing record and repairs one existing CNAME, but refuses to
delete or overwrite conflicting A/AAAA/multiple records. Resolve those by hand
after identifying their owner.

Keep `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` in GitHub Secrets and `CLOUDFLARE_ZONE_ID` in
Actions Variables. The token needs only Zone:DNS:Edit and Zone:Read for
`sprue.works`; never use or document the Global API Key.

With legacy branch-based Pages, `PUT /repos/{owner}/{repo}/pages` with a new
`cname` writes `docs/CNAME` directly to the configured publishing branch as an
automatic `Create CNAME` commit when that file is absent. Prefer merging the
intended `docs/CNAME` first. If Pages bootstrap must happen before the PR
merges, fetch and rebase onto the automatic commit before pushing the PR branch.

GitHub only requests the managed certificate when the custom domain is *saved
while DNS already resolves*. If the domain was configured before the CNAME
existed (the normal order for this repo: Pages first, `pages-dns.yml` after
merge), `https_certificate` stayed `null` for 30+ minutes with no sign of progress,
and re-sending the same `cname` does nothing. Clear it and re-add it, all
against `PUT /repos/{owner}/{repo}/pages`:

1. `{"cname": null}`
2. `{"cname": "polyglot.sprue.works"}` — the cert reached `approved` within
   a minute.
3. `{"https_enforced": true}`
