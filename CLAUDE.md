# Polyglot Slides — working notes

## Where things live

- `src/` — the add-on itself. `Code.js` (modes, selection, translation),
  `Sidebar.html` (the sidebar UI), `appsscript.json` (manifest + OAuth scopes).
- `README.md` — what it does, the modes, known limitations, and the developer
  loop (`clasp push`, test deployments).
- `INSTALL.md` — developer-only: the test-deployment loop for running a build
  of `src/` in a real deck, its permissions gotcha, the second-account
  verification checklist, and a one-line note on the retired template deck.
  Not the install path: the Marketplace listing is (see "The listing is live"
  at the bottom of this file).
- `tools/release.sh` — tagged-release pipeline (push + numbered version;
  nothing is deployed); `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` runs it and opens the
  "bump script version" tracking issue. README "Release pipeline" is the
  human-facing doc, including the secret setup and the manual remainder.
- `marketplace/` — the Workspace Marketplace listing as data: `listing.json`
  (what a human pastes into the Marketplace SDK / consent screen), the icon
  and screenshots, and `RUNBOOK.md` (the click-through). `docs/` is the
  GitHub Pages site (homepage + privacy + terms) brand verification needs;
  its look comes from the sprue.works brand theme (see "The docs site is
  styled by the brand theme" below), enforced by `tools/test-docs-theme.sh`.
  `tools/check-listing.sh` is the contract: listing scopes == manifest scopes,
  script reference resolves to `.clasp.json#scriptId` (the one field the
  Editor-add-on console form consumes that the repo can verify; the version
  number it also pins is deliberately not mirrored), assets exist at the
  right sizes,
  publisher is `sprue.works` with an `@sprue.works` support address (brand
  verification checks name, support email, and homepage domain agree).
- `.claude/settings.json` — declares the claude-toolbox plugin marketplace
  (<https://github.com/maguerrieri/claude-toolbox>) and enables its
  `defaults` meta-plugin, so the toolbox plugins load in Claude Code here.
- This file — gotchas that aren't visible from the code.

Two user-facing surfaces deliver messages differently and always have: sidebar
runs write to `#status` in `Sidebar.html`, menu runs call `SlidesApp.getUi()
.alert()` in `menuRun_`. That asymmetry is tracked in #6, not a bug to fix
in passing.

## The template deck is retired, not deleted

The pre-Marketplace "copy the template deck" path (#2) is gone from the docs
since #55: the listing replaced it, and it cost a second copy of `src/` in a
bound script that drifted silently. The Drive deck and its bound script still
exist (IDs in INSTALL.md's retired note and `marketplace/RUNBOOK.md`'s
"Retired" note); copies made from it are frozen at the code they were copied
with, which is inherent to bound scripts. Don't resurrect a sync script or a
recipient-facing doc for it — if a template is ever needed again (listing
pulled), recreate one via `clasp create --type slides --title "Polyglot
Slides"` and rename the *deck* afterwards in Drive: a **container-bound**
script's Extensions submenu takes the *script project's* name, so the bound
script must be titled exactly `Polyglot Slides`.

## Verifying the listing needs a second Google account

The owner's account cannot exercise the flow that matters — a non-owner
installing the listing and seeing the real consent screen. Don't claim it is
verified off owner-side testing. INSTALL.md carries the second-account
checklist; **its functional sweep has never been run end to end** (#54 owes
it). The 2026-09-15 listing run was an install smoke test — consent screen,
menu present, one translation — not the regression checklist passing.

## The Apps Script project is org-owned, and that cannot be undone or redone later

The script project in `.clasp.json` is owned by the `@sprue.works` publishing
account (ideally inside a sprue.works Shared Drive), **not** by a personal
Google account — the same side of the fence as GCP project `556097262294`,
the OAuth consent screen, the Search Console property, and the `help@` /
`contact@` groups. #36 recreated it there before #20 submitted the listing.

Why recreate rather than transfer: **Google does not transfer Drive ownership
across the consumer/Workspace boundary** — an Apps Script project is a Drive
file, and the restriction is a deliberate data-protection rule, not a setting
(<https://support.google.com/a/answer/1247799>). The only alternatives were a
Shared Drive move with several admin-side moving parts, or a new project. A
new project was cheap only while nothing was published and no one had
installed the add-on; after launch the same change is a migration that strands
every existing install, because the Marketplace listing pins the script ID.

Consequences, so nobody "fixes" this back:

- Never point `.clasp.json` at a personally owned project again, even for
  convenience — the personal account can be *shared in* as an editor, but the
  listing must keep pinning the org-owned ID.
- `CLASPRC_JSON` must be minted **by the publishing account** (README
  "One-time setup"); a personal account's token only works while that account
  is shared in, and re-minting is the fix, not re-pointing the script.
- Attaching the script to the GCP project (RUNBOOK §3b) and the Marketplace
  SDK's *Project Script ID* + *version* (§4) are per-project facts that had to be
  redone for the new project; a new project's versions start at `1`.
- The old personal project still exists, orphaned. Leave it; don't delete it.
- A developer's personal account is *shared in* as an editor on the org-owned
  project — that is what `clasp push` and INSTALL.md's test deployments run as.

## CI deploys authenticate as a user, and the deployment ID is *not* what the Marketplace pins

- Apps Script's API rejects service accounts for script projects, so
  `deploy.yml` uses a copied `~/.clasprc.json` (secret `CLASPRC_JSON`) handed to
  clasp 3 via the `clasp_config_auth` env var. The secret is the **whole** file
  (`{"tokens":{"default":{...}}}`), not a token; clasp 3 also reads the legacy
  `{token, oauth2ClientSettings}` shape, so a clasp 2 file works too. Don't
  read the local `~/.clasprc.json` — it's a credential file.
- The Apps Script API has **two** switches: the GCP project's API
  enablement (RUNBOOK §2) and a **per-user** toggle at
  `script.google.com/home/usersettings` that only the deploying account can
  flip. `clasp push` works with the per-user toggle off; `clasp version`
  fails (`User has not enabled the Apps Script API`) — so a green
  push-to-main deploy is not proof the account can cut versions. The
  `v1.0.1` tag run after #36 failed exactly that way. `deploy.yml` runs
  `tools/preflight.sh` (`clasp list-versions`) right after auth (#38); if it
  reports the toggle error, the fix is the toggle, not the token.
- **`invalid_rapt` at the preflight is Workspace session control, not the
  toggle and not a bad token (#51).** Every push-to-main deploy from
  2026-09-11 to 2026-09-12 failed at the preflight with
  `{"error":"invalid_grant","error_description":"reauth related error
  (invalid_rapt)", ...}`. Since #36 the `CLASPRC_JSON` token belongs to the
  `@sprue.works` account, and a Workspace account under a Google Cloud
  session-control policy must periodically re-authenticate interactively,
  which a headless runner cannot do. Personal Gmail accounts never hit this,
  which is why the pipeline worked before #36. Re-minting the token is *not*
  the fix: a fresh token buys exactly one session and then fails the same
  way. The fix is in the Admin console, and is narrower than exempting the
  account or OU (the reauth policy stays in force for everything else):
  1. *Security → Access and data control → Google Cloud session control* →
     enable **Never require reauthentication for trusted apps**;
  2. *Security → API controls → App access control* → mark **clasp's OAuth
     client as a trusted app**.
  No re-mint was needed afterwards; the re-run of the failed run succeeded.
  `tools/preflight.sh` recognises `invalid_rapt` and prints this pointer;
  `tools/test-preflight.sh` pins that mapping with a stubbed clasp.
- **Docs-only merges no longer produce a Deploy run at all (#51).** The
  `push: branches: [main]` trigger carries a `paths` filter (`src/**`,
  `.clasp.json`, `tools/release.sh`, `tools/preflight.sh`, the workflow
  itself). Before it, every docs merge ran `clasp push` against an unchanged
  `src/`, so an auth failure was red on every merge and masked real ones. No
  Deploy run after a README change is the intended signal, not a broken
  trigger. GitHub does not evaluate `paths` for tag pushes, so `v*` and
  `workflow_dispatch` always run; `track-version-bump` is unchanged (it
  already gates on `github.ref_type == 'tag'`). Anything new that clasp
  ships or the pipeline runs must be added to that list, or pushes touching
  only it will silently not deploy.
- GitHub Actions expression contexts are placement-sensitive: `runner.*` is
  unavailable in job-level `env`, even though the file is valid YAML. Run
  `tools/lint-workflows.sh` after workflow edits; it uses actionlint to catch
  expression-context failures before GitHub rejects the workflow definition.
- **Corrected 2026-09-02 (#19):** the Marketplace SDK App Configuration for an
  *Editor add-on* pins **Project Script ID + script version number**, and has
  no deployment-ID field at all — that field exists only for the *Google
  Workspace add-on* integration type, a different architecture (`addOns`
  manifest block, card UI) this add-on does not use. Google's docs: "to
  publish an Editor add-on, you must provide the project script ID and
  version", and to ship an update, "update the version number on the App
  Configuration page". Earlier notes here claimed the listing points at a
  deployment ID and that releases reach installed users automatically; both
  were wrong. The real path is: tag → `tools/release.sh` creates version *n*
  → **a human bumps *Slides add-on script version* to *n*** in App
  Configuration (RUNBOOK §4). A version bump alone does not trigger
  Marketplace re-review; users don't reinstall.
- **Since #29** the pipeline matches that: `tools/release.sh` is `clasp push`
  + `clasp version` and nothing else — no deployment, no `deployment.json`
  (the old deployment still exists in Apps Script, orphaned and harmless).
  The **pinned version number is not mirrored in the repo** — `check-listing.sh`
  fails if a `publishedVersion` key appears. #29 first added one (recording
  "what is live", bumped by hand after the paste) and then removed it: the
  repo can neither read nor write the console, so the copy was pure
  bookkeeping that could only drift, and it cost a second manual step per
  release. The record is the tag workflow's tracking issue (*release vX: bump
  Slides add-on script version to N*, assigned to whoever pushed the tag):
  open means the bump is owed, closed means it was done. The step summary
  carries the same instruction.
- `tools/test-release.sh` pins the exact clasp call sequence with a stub. Change
  the sequence deliberately and update the expectations together.

## The listing is data the human pastes, and CI guards the paste

Google has no write API for the Marketplace SDK listing or the OAuth consent
screen, so `marketplace/listing.json` can't be *applied* — it's the paste
source, and `tools/check-listing.sh` is what keeps the paste honest. Two
consequences:

- Changing `oauthScopes` in `appsscript.json` fails CI until `listing.json`
  matches — on purpose. A scope change also needs the consent screen and the
  Marketplace SDK updated by hand and triggers re-verification; the CI failure
  is the reminder.
- The Editor-add-on listing is pinned to the **script ID plus a version
  number** (RUNBOOK §4), not to a deployment and not to HEAD. A tagged
  release does nothing for installed users until that version field is
  bumped by hand; `listing.json`'s `extension.script` mirrors the script-ID
  field, the version number stays console-only (see above), and
  `check-listing.sh` rejects both the old `extension.deployment` pointer and
  a `publishedVersion` key if either comes back.
- Console facts the runbook now carries because they aren't in Google's docs:
  Apps Script refuses *Change GCP project* until the target project has a
  saved OAuth consent screen (so consent screen before attach);
  `script.container.ui` is absent from the *Add or remove scopes* table and
  must be pasted into *Manually add scopes*; it is classified **sensitive**
  (sensitive-scope verification — justification + demo video — not brand
  verification alone; CASA is for *restricted* scopes only); the Marketplace
  SDK has no left-nav entry (its API Library page → *Manage*); App visibility
  Private/Public is irreversible once saved. GCP project number: 556097262294.

## The docs site is styled by the brand theme, and the legal pages' text is pinned

`docs/*.html` carry no inline `<style>`. Each links
`https://sprue.works/brand/v1/theme.css` (the org's CSS custom properties,
`--sw-*`; usage notes in `brand/README.md` of sprue-works/website) and then
`docs/site.css`, which maps those tokens onto elements and defines no colour
or font of its own. Every `var(--sw-*)` carries a fallback so an unreachable
sprue.works degrades to readable, not to invalid CSS — and the theme only
ships light-scheme fallbacks that way, so with the theme blocked the pages
render light in both schemes; that is the intended degradation. Missing tokens
are an issue on sprue-works/website, not a literal here; product-specific
branding is the icon, an image, so nothing overrides the theme. The theme is
served `immutable` for a year, so a value change upstream reaches repeat
visitors slowly.

`tools/test-docs-theme.sh` (CI) enforces the link order, no literal colours or
font-families, and the fallbacks — sizes and spacing follow the theme scale by
convention only, since a checker can't tell a layout constant from a missed
token — and pins the **text content** of `docs/privacy.html` and
`docs/terms.html` to `tools/fixtures/docs-text/*.txt`. Google's OAuth
verification reviews those pages' wording and a change restarts the round
(#41), so styling work must leave the text byte-identical and CI fails if it
doesn't. A deliberate wording change regenerates the fixtures in the same
commit with `tools/test-docs-theme.sh --update-fixtures`. A wording change
also **bumps the effective date** on the page it edits (the Changes section
promises one), even when the brief says to keep everything outside the
edited sections byte-identical — that rule protects the other sections and
`terms.html`, not the date line. #49 first left the date stale on that
reading and the review caught it.

## QuickLook thumbnails don't scale SVGs with an intrinsic size

`tools/render-icons.sh` falls back to macOS `qlmanage -t -s 512` when
`rsvg-convert` is missing. QuickLook draws the SVG at its **intrinsic**
`width`/`height` (128×128 on `icon.svg`) onto the requested canvas without
scaling, so the mark lands in the top-left quarter of a 512×512 white square
and `sips -z` then shrinks that whole padded canvas. Every icon PNG passed the
dimensions-only check that way (#27). The script now rewrites the root
`width`/`height` to the render size in a scratch copy before thumbnailing, and
`tools/png-check.js` (shared with `tools/check-listing.sh`) fails any icon
whose artwork doesn't reach all four quadrants. Don't infer a render is right
from its pixel size — open the PNG.

QuickLook also mishandles a **non-square viewBox**: `banner.svg` (viewBox
220×140) thumbnailed at an intrinsic 880×560 came out 880×642, scaled
non-uniformly and clipped at the sides (#31). `render-icons.sh` therefore pads
the scratch copy's viewBox to a square (`0 -40 220 220`) at a square intrinsic
size, renders, and crops the banner band back out with `sips -c … --cropOffset`
before downsampling. Keep the viewBox aspect equal to the intrinsic aspect,
and square, whenever qlmanage is the renderer.

## The Pages hostname is one DNS-only CNAME

`polyglot.sprue.works` must be exactly one Cloudflare CNAME to
`sprue-works.github.io` with `proxied=false`. Cloudflare proxying hides the
Pages target and can block GitHub's domain verification and managed-certificate
provisioning. `tools/reconcile-pages-dns.sh` is intentionally conservative:
it creates a missing record and repairs one existing CNAME, but refuses to
delete or overwrite conflicting A/AAAA/multiple records. Resolve those by hand
after identifying their owner.

Keep `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` in GitHub Secrets and `CLOUDFLARE_ZONE_ID` in
Actions Variables. The token needs only Zone:DNS:Edit and Zone:Read for
`sprue.works`; never use or document the Global API Key.

With legacy branch-based Pages, `PUT /repos/{owner}/{repo}/pages` with a new
`cname` writes `docs/CNAME` directly to the configured publishing branch as an
automatic `Create CNAME` commit when that file is absent. Prefer merging the
intended `docs/CNAME` first. If Pages bootstrap must happen before the PR
merges, fetch and rebase onto the automatic commit before pushing the PR branch.

GitHub only requests the managed certificate when the custom domain is *saved
while DNS already resolves*. If the domain was configured before the CNAME
existed (the normal order for this repo: Pages first, `pages-dns.yml` after
merge), `https_certificate` stayed `null` for 30+ minutes with no sign of progress,
and re-sending the same `cname` does nothing. Clear it and re-add it, all
against `PUT /repos/{owner}/{repo}/pages`:

1. `{"cname": null}`
2. `{"cname": "polyglot.sprue.works"}` — the cert reached `approved` within
   a minute.
3. `{"https_enforced": true}`

## The listing is live, and the consent screen is frozen

Both Google reviews are approved and the add-on is published:

- **OAuth verification approved 2026-09-13** — brand verification plus the
  sensitive scope `script.container.ui`.
- **Marketplace listing review approved 2026-09-15**; a second account
  install-tested the live listing the same day and it passed — clean consent
  screen, no unverified-app interstitial, `Extensions → Polyglot Slides` in a
  fresh deck, translation ran. That is an install smoke test, not INSTALL.md's
  full functional sweep, which is still owed on every entry point.
- Live listing (`unlisted`, link-only, not searchable):
  <https://workspace.google.com/marketplace/app/polyglot_slides/556097262294>
  — committed in `docs/index.html` (`#install`) and README "Install".

The binding rule from Google's approval email, which is the part that changes
how this repo is edited: **any change to the OAuth consent screen
configuration, or any new scope, requires a new verification request —
verification is not inherited.** So treat the consent screen as frozen. App
name, logo, support email, homepage, privacy-policy and terms URLs, and the
scope list are no longer free to edit: each re-opens a review round, weeks
rather than days for a sensitive scope. That is a cost to plan for, not a
prohibition — but it is never a drive-by change, and `marketplace/RUNBOOK.md`
§6 Post-live plus its "Ongoing" table are where the per-change consequences
live. `tools/check-listing.sh` failing on a `listing.json` /
`src/appsscript.json` scope mismatch is that reminder firing.

**Code releases are exempt.** Bumping the pinned *Slides add-on script version*
after a tagged release is not a consent-screen change and triggers no
re-review — that mechanism is unchanged (see "CI deploys authenticate as a
user" above).

`INSTALL.md` is no longer an install document. It is the **developer test
loop** — a test deployment putting a specific build of `src/` in front of a
specific deck, which is the only way to run HEAD since the listing pins a
version — plus the second-account checklist. Don't re-promote it to "how to
install"; the listing is that now.
