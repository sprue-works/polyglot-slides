# Remote state in the GCS bucket that sprue-works/infrastructure provisions for
# this repository (its `consumers` map entry `polyglot-slides`). The block is
# deliberately empty: bucket and prefix are non-secret and are passed at
# `terraform init` from the repository variables TF_STATE_BUCKET and
# TF_STATE_PREFIX, so the values live in one place (see
# .github/workflows/terraform.yml and README.md "Terraform").
#
# Only the apply job of that workflow, running on a push to this repository's
# refs/heads/main ref, can authenticate to the bucket: the foundation's
# workload identity provider trusts exactly that OIDC subject. Pull requests
# and other branches are rejected, so PR runs validate with -backend=false
# and never plan.
