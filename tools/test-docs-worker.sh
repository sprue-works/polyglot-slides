#   - /, /privacy.html, /terms.html answer 200 directly -- no redirect of any
#     kind, because Google holds those exact URLs (marketplace/RUNBOOK.md);
#   - each body is byte-identical to the file under docs/;
#   - the extensionless paths GitHub Pages served (/privacy, /terms) still
#     resolve, and an unknown path is a 404;
#   - _redirects itself is not served.
#
# Needs node + network on first run (npx fetches wrangler). Used by
# .github/workflows/ci.yml; run locally before changing wrangler.jsonc or
# docs/_redirects.
